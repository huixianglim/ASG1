# Project Name: MOVIEX
this project is to essentially recreate an entire movie review website from scratch. It will showcase the hottest movies and the reviews, ratings and descriptions for it. This website is made such that it has many functions available to the users so that they can easily navigate and filter out what specific movies that they would wana learn more of. 

#Design Process
For my design process, I first started on focusing my target audience, on whom I would want to help them out and I settle down on movie watchers. Afterwards, I started thinking on how I would want my overall flow of my website to be and this is how my final thought out process goes. When a user first click on the website, they will be brought to the introduction website where they are introduced to what they website does for them afterwards, they can either click on a button to start their journey or they can click on one of the the nav buttons which will bring them to the movie page. It is here in the movie page that they can search for the movies they want, or they can filter out what movies they want, either by choronological order or by genre order. After clicking on the specific movie that they would want, they would then be able to see a short trailer of the movie, ratings of the movie, movie description and lastly, the movie main characters. They would also be able to submit their own reviews to the website.

# Features 
As for the features of this websites, firstly, there is a universal nav bar which will either link you to either the introduction or movie page.
There is also an auto moving slideshow where the images on the slideshow will automatically move.
Once you go to the movie page, likewise, there is a nav bar and there is also a search bar. In this search bar you can search for the specific movies that you may want to find out more about. Below that are all swiper slides. The first swiper slide has nothing special while the other two has specific filter allocated to it. The filters goes as shown: 
- A drop down filter where you can filter the movies that you would want chronologically
- A button filter where you can click on the specific filter of genre onto the movies that you would want.
Besides the filters, each slider contains a row of movies which you can click on which will bring you to the movie page.
At the end of the movie page, there is a link to the citation page which is the list of citations used for the website. (It will have a universal nav bar and also a back to movie page button)
Now moving onto the movie review page.
Firstly, there will be a universal nav bar like usual and there would also be a short trailer imported from youtube which you can click on. Moving on, below the movie trailer is the movie name and ratings and also the movie description which is the summary of the whole pot for the movie. Below all that there is a form where  you can give your reviews of the movie itself. You can click on what stars of ratings you would want the movie to be and add any additional movie comments that you may want.
At the bottom of the website there is a back to movie button wher you can click to be directed back to the movie website. 
No other features that i wanted to implement. At first i wanted to implement a moving background but after trying out so, i discovered that it does not fit the design so i scrapped that idea.
#Testing
As for testing, I just kept on clicking on every function that I newly implemented. Some problems I found along the way was that some of the functions will clash against each other and in order to fix this, i decided to use multiple script.js files so that it fits each page will and nicely. Second thing that I tested alot was the media query css. I went to replit.com and posted my html, css and js files there and run the website on my phone to see how a mobile device would interact with the website itself. I used replit alot to fix my search bar recommendations and also my characters slider as the content would always overflow on phone but thankfully now  i managed to fix it. 
I discovered some bugs along the way with my website. Firstly, some of the elements are positioned relative and this created some empty white space towards the left hand side of screen and in order to fix this i used the overflow-y:hidden functions.
As for how the mobile version of the website looks like, the form for the movie ratings webpage will be bigger and the word fonts generally will slightly be bigger but the filter button for the movie page, the genre one will be smaller in order to fit everything tgt. On mobile, the amount of slides per view is around 2. More or less its almost the same, with just elements like the nav bar, search bar and word fonts being smaller.
